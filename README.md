## üîß How It Works  

### 1. Dataset  
The model is trained on traffic sign datasets, such as the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/).  

### 2. Preprocessing  
- **Image Resizing**: Images are resized to a fixed dimension (e.g., 30x30 pixels).  
- **Normalization**: Pixel values are normalized to improve model convergence.  
- **Label Encoding**: Signs are categorized into numerical labels for supervised learning.  

### 3. CNN Architecture  
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features like edges and shapes.  
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce dimensionality while retaining essential features.  
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Perform classification based on extracted features.  
- **Softmax Output**: Produces probabilities for each class, identifying the most likely traffic sign.  

### 4. Training  
- **Supervised Learning**: The CNN is trained using labeled traffic sign images.  
- **Loss Function**: Categorical cross-entropy measures the error between predicted and actual labels.  
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer adjusts weights to minimize loss.  

### 5. Evaluation  
- The model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrices to measure performance on unseen data.
